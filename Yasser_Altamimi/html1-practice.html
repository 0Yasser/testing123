    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Consuming TV Shows</h2>
    <p>Usually it's my fav leisure activity</p>
    <h2>Hanging out</h2>
    <p>
      With friends, either to do physical activities (football, ping pong, pool)
      or without them.
    </p>
    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <h2>Starting a great career</h2>
    <p>Ultimate goal</p>
    <h2>Enhancing my skills</h2>
    <p>
      In programming, and not to take a long breaks from programming, since I
      currently felt dulled after stopping for few months
